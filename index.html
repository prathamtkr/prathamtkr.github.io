      <main class="content" role="main">
        <p class="intro-paragraph">I'm <strong>Pratham Thakkar</strong>, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at VIT Bhopal University, with a specialization in <strong>Health Informatics</strong>. Most of my undergraduate reasearch work is at the intersection of machine learning and its applications across various domains. Beyond this, I am particularly interested in building explainable and trustworthy AI models to better understand their inner workings and decision-making processes.</p>
        
        <p class="intro-paragraph">I enjoy connecting ideas across disciplines and fitting them into the realm of artificial intelligence â€” from <strong>genetics and evolution</strong> to <strong>neuroscience and sports analytics</strong>, finding parallels that help me think about intelligence and learning in new ways. Outside research, I'm a huge sports enthusiast, closely following <strong>Formula 1, football, tennis, and cricket</strong>, and I often find the strategy and performance dynamics in these games inspiring for how we think about systems and optimization.</p>

        <p class="intro-paragraph">At the heart of my work is curiosity: whether it's in academia or sports, I'm drawn to understanding why things work the way they do and how that understanding can push us toward better solutions.</p>
        
        <h3 class="section-title">Current Research Interests</h3>
        <ul class="interest-list">
          <li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> bridging interpretability and performance by combining techniques like LRP, Integrated Gradients, and causal inference.</li>
          <li><strong>NN Architectures & Training Paradigms:</strong> exploring new ways of structuring and training models for robustness and generalization.
</li>
          <li><strong>Applied ML:</strong> using current generation of models to explore its uses cases for betterment of humanity across various domains like Healthcare, Finance and Agriculture.

  <!-- === BEYOND RESEARCH SECTION === -->
<h3 class="section-title">Beyond Research</h3>

<div class="prose-section">
  <p>When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll probably find me in one of these zones:</p>

  <ul class="interest-list">
          <li>Did I mention I love sports? <strong>Arsenal</strong> occupies way too much of my weekends (and mood). I love dissecting football tactics, the tiniest detail of an F1 pit strategy, or looking at F1 telemetry.</li>
          <li>Apart from that, I love reading about other scientific fields like <strong>neuroscience, evolution, and astrophysics</strong> â€” ideas that spark connections with my research and keep me questioning how intelligence and the universe really work. <em>Currently Reading - The Gene by Siddharta Mukherjee</em>.</li>
          <li>Whether itâ€™s debating Arsenalâ€™s midfield balance, swapping thoughts on the latest F1 race, or exploring how new scientific theories might reshape AI, I enjoy conversations that mix passion with curiosity.</li>
        </ul>  
  <p class="final-cta">
    Iâ€™m always open to discussing research, sports, or ideas that stretch the imagination. <br>
